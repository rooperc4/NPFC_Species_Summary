abstract = {Alfonsino (Beryx splendens and B. decadactylus) are benthopelagic species found in waters of 25-1 300 m depth, commonly in aggregations over rocky bottoms. They are distributed along the European and African coasts, around oceanic islands of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Indian Ocean. Alfonsino is also found in the northern Tasman Sea, along the Pacific coast of the Japanese Archipelago, the Southern Emperor and Northern Hawaiian ridges and westwards towards Chile. Alfonsino are fished around the Azores, in the Southeast Atlantic, and in the SouthwestIndian Ocean. There is also a small fishery for them in coastal waters of Australia and New Zealand and a Japanese fishery on the SouthernEmperorseamounts and in the southern area ofthe Northern HawaiianRidge. A major fishery, now closed, existed around the Juan Fern{\'{a}}ndez Archipelago in the Eastern Pacific. Alfonsino have a schooling behaviour that is evident throughout their life: they form aggregations during the day and scatter above the bottom at night. Tagging studies indicate limited migration, possiblywith regional differences. Feeding occursmainly in themorning and eveningtwilight hours, and there is an increase in feeding with the intensity of tidal flow. Alfonsino feed for longer periods when there is less food available. Alfonsino reach a fork length of 15–20 cm in their first year, about 25 cm after 3 years and 40 cm after 10 years. In the Canary Islands, the oldest fish examined were 9 years old (38 cm); 11 years (40 cm) in the Azores; and 12 years in Madeira (41 cm). On the South West Indian Ridge, the maximum length of alfonsino was 60 cm fork length and with a maximum weight 6 260 g. Growthrelated parameter values and length–weight relations determined for several oceanic areas are reviewed. Alfonsino begin to mature in their second year, and most are mature by their fifth or sixth year; 50 percent maturity occurs at lengths from 23 to 44 cm. Alfonsino spawn during the spring and summer with severalspawning episodes. Alfonsino larvae are presumed to develop from epipelagic eggs. Differences in the sex ratio of alfonsino occur in different areas. Hypotheses of alfonsino population structures are reviewed.Two genetic clades have been identified that appear to coexist, and single stocks are known to span broad areas. DNA studies of decadactylus indicate that there are genetic differences between stocks in the Azores and the western North Atlantic, but not with the eastern North Atlantic. In the Southern Indian Ocean, some studies have been done but the conclusions are constrained by the nature of the sample size and their geographical distribution. A review of the implications of the genetic studiesfor population structure is given.Population biology parameters and estimates ofstock sizesin differentregions are reviewed. Ecosystem effects do not seem to be significant as bycatch, as recorded, is minor in alfonsino fisheries. The role of alfonsino as a possible prey species remains unknown. Little has been documented about the impact of trawl fishing for alfonsino on fragile benthic fauna. Because the size and value of the harvests of alfonsino in any one fishery are usually too small to justify expensive management measures and fisheries research for alfonsino, their management often does not attract adequate attention. Effective management of high seas alfonsino fisheries will depend on the ability of regional fisheries management organizations to manage fishing effort targeting alfonsino stocks and ensure compliance with conservation regulations. Given the importance of fish processing at sea, studies are provided to determine appropriate product conversion factorsfrom which round weights can be estimated from production records.},
