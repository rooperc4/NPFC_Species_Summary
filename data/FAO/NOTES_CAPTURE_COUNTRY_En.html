<div id="CHINA">
<h4>CHINA</h4>
<p>For statistical purposes, the data for China do not include Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR), Macao SAR and Taiwan Province of China.<p></p>In recent years the catch data for 1997-2005 have been revised, on the basis of official reports by the Chinese authorities of a reduction in fisheries production of around 10 percent in 2006 by the Second National Agriculture Census conducted in 2007. China’s statistics for 1997–2005 were subsequently adjusted downwards, in line with the revised data for 2006.<p></p>The Chinese authorities similarly revised catches downwards for the period 2012-2016, based on the results of the Third National Agriculture Census conducted in 2016.  For the 2016 reference year, catches were revised at individual species level (with an overall reduction of total capture production of around 10 percent), while catches for 2012-2015 were adjusted down at an aggregated level. Revisions to the catches by species for 2012-2015 were then implemented by FAO.<p></p>Following the same rationale, and in consultation with China, FAO subsequently revised its historical statistics for China for the period 2009–2011 to better reflect the overall development of China’s fisheries production and avoid a major break in the overall catch series and trends.<p></p>Data concerning tuna catches are reviewed in collaboration with ICCAT and IOTC, the regional agencies concerned with tuna statistics.<p></p>Catch data, excluding those for tuna species, for the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic areas are reviewed and validated with data taken from the Las Palmas Survey (LPS), the "Bulletin Statistique" published by IMROP (Mauritania), and the “Estatistícas de Pesca Industrial” published by CIPA (Guinea-Bissau).<p></p>Catch data, excluding those for tuna species, for the Southwest Atlantic area are reviewed and validated with data provided by the Fisheries Department, Falkland Islands Government.<p></p>Catch data, excluding those for tuna species, for the South Pacific high seas area are reviewed in collaboration with SPRFMO.<p></p>Catches in the Antarctic region (FAO Major Fishing Areas 48, 58 and 88) are reviewed in collaboration with the Commission for the  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

<p>Official catches increased sharply in 2019 due to data from a Catch Assessment Survey in Lake Albert indicating that catches had more than doubled for most species, partly as a result of the impacts of illegal fishing and increase in fishing pressure. Relatively large increases in capture production from 2004 and 2007 onwards are also due, respectively, to improvements in coverage of the data collection system, and the inclusion of illegal catch estimates and emerging fisheries for new species.</p>
