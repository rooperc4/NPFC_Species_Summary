abstract = {Growth is an important factor that regulates survival during early life stages, and growth rates and recruitment are often thought to be positively related. However, environmental conditions generally fluctuate over time, which could lead to temporal changes in growth–recruitment relationships. Here, we investigate whether growth–recruitment relationships are time-varying by applying dynamic linear models, which allow coefficients to vary over time, to a 23-yr data set of recruitment and early life-stage growth rate in Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus. We found that the impact of growth rate on recruitment (i.e., the slope coefficient) was relatively high during the late 1990s, then gradually weakened, and has remained low in recent years. The baseline recruitment level (i.e., the intercept) also shifted over time, being relatively low in the late 1990s, gradually increasing, and remaining high in recent years. Furthermore, a model with time-varying intercept and slope was more statistically plausible than models with constant coefficients. These results indicate that the growth–recruitment relationship varied dynamically over time. Our findings highlight the need to consider the possibility of time-varying growth–recruitment relationships when investigating such relationships and predicting recruitment.},

abstract = {Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) in the Sea of Japan expanded their distribution from the coast to offshore with an increase in population biomass; however, little is known about the suitability of the offshore habitat for this species. Using lipid analysis, this study compared the body condition of juvenile sardine between an area off the Noto Peninsula (offshore) and the Tsushima Strait (coast), with respect to habitat conditions during the summer, from 2015 to 2017. Sardine in the offshore area had larger bodies and higher lipid contents than those in the coastal area. Regarding the sardine diet, lipid content of the offshore zooplankton was clearly higher than that of the coastal zooplankton. Hence, we found a positive effect of this dietary lipid content on sardine lipid content, suggesting that these lipid measurements could explain the trophic relationship between sardine and zooplankton. The higher lipid content in offshore zooplankton was mainly attributed to the abundance of large-sized copepods and lower water temperatures. Such lipid measurements might involve habitat-specific characteristics of zooplankton assemblage. In conclusion, compared to the coastal area, the offshore area is considered a more favorable habitat for the sardine in terms of lipid availability.},

abstract = {Stock level of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) was high from 1980s to early 1990s and low from late 1990s to 2000s. The warm and cold water masses in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter to early spring used to be critical for the recruitment in the high-stock period, because most of the larvae were distributed there. However, the environmental fluctuation might not affect the recruitment in the low-stock period. Some studies reported that spawning location and spawning season, and hence the larval habitat, differ depending on the stock level. Three points were investigated in this study: (a) how spawning location and spawning season shifted from the late 1990s, (b) confirmation of the distribution area of larvae in the recent low-stock period and (c) whether the water temperature in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis was still related to the recruitment in the low-stock period. The spawning location and spawning season clearly changed after 1995. Consequently, particle tracking experiments suggested that the larvae appeared in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter to early spring decreased. Nevertheless, only the ambient temperature of larvae that appeared in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter had a significant negative correlation with an index of the recruitment in the low-stock period. It is suggested that the warm and cold masses in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis are critical for the recruitment regardless of the stock level.},

abstract = {Proportionality between spawning stock biomass (SSB) and annual total egg production (TEP) has been an inherent assumption in spawner–recruitment models for fisheries management and studies on recruitment mechanisms in fish. However, recent evidence of density dependence in egg production has led to a need to reconsider the validity of recruitment per spawning stock biomass (RPS), which is a SSB-based survival index from hatching to recruitment, in recruitment studies. Here we revisit sardine recruitment hypotheses based on recruitment per egg production (RPE), which is a TEP-based survival index, by reanalyzing published data for the Pacific stock of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) in the Kuroshio Current system at a multidecadal scale. By adopting RPE, we detected statistically significant relationships of the survival from hatching to recruitment to large-scale ocean climate anomaly, ambient temperature in the nursery grounds and growth rate during the early life stages. None of these relationships were detected by RPS. We propose the adoption of TEP-based survival indices rather than SSB-based ones in future studies on recruitment mechanisms of fish in relation to environmental and biological factors. Developing egg-production-based survival indices has the potential to improve understanding of recruitment mechanisms of fish under climate variability.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns in spawning of fish influence growth and survival by affecting the environment experienced by offspring during their early life stages. Therefore, identifying changes in spawning patterns can help researchers understand population dynamics and recruitment fluctuations. The Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus is a small pelagic fish that undergoes large stock fluctuations. Although spawning patterns are known to change spatially and temporally with stock abundance, little information is available on the processes underlying stock increases. This study aimed to describe changes in spawning pattern and early growth of Japanese sardine during the recent period of stock increase and to clarify the effects of different spawning periods on offspring growth. We examined trends in egg abundance in the western North Pacific in 2004–2018 and analyzed hatch dates and growth trajectories by otolith microstructure analysis of juveniles from the Kuroshio–Oyashio transition region (the species' main nursery area). During the study period, the main spawning area shifted from the western to the eastern part of this region off Japan, and spawning in the eastern part roughly coincided with juvenile hatch dates. Hatch dates also shifted from mid-March at the earliest to February and early March from 2013 onward. Although early-hatched cohorts (which originate offshore of eastern Japan) experienced slower initial growth, they likely played an important role in the recent stock increase. Successful recruitment of these cohorts may have been facilitated by factors such as early hatching and transport to the nursery, which reduces the frequency of predator encounters.},

abstract = {The distribution of small pelagic fish species changes in association with fluctuating stock biomass. We analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamics of Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus inhabiting the Sea of Japan during periods of stock biomass fluctuation using generalized additive models (GAMs). Logbook data from drift gill net surveys and large- and medium-type purse seine fisheries, conducted from 1970 to 1999, were used. A 2-step data analysis was performed: (1) for the presence or absence of sardine, and (2) for the catch per unit effort (CPUE) where fish were present. The explanatory variables in the GAMs were year, longitude/ latitude, sea surface temperature, and fishing method. The best model based on Akaike's information criterion showed that the likelihood of high sardine presence was limited to areas around the Oki and Tsushima Islands in the early 1970s. However, these areas expanded south along the coast and offshore to the north until the mid-1980s. Subsequently, sardine presence contracted to the initial distribution areas during the mid-1990s. Over the 30 yr period, the spatial distribution of the CPUE changed minimally for both fishing methods. Compared with the trajectory of stock biomass, the potential distribution area began expanding during the initial phase of population expansion, and started contracting before biomass peaked. There was a time lag between the peaks of distribution area and biomass. In conclusion, we discuss how changes to oceanographic conditions in response to a climate regime shift may influence the distribution of Japanese sardine in the Sea of Japan.},

Because relationships between SSChl a and in situ chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly different among periods based on the satellite combinations used, maximum and minimum SSChl a concentrations of 1 year were relativized as 1 and 0, respectively. Spatio-temporal variation of relativized SSChl a concentrations was determined by using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Scores in the first EOF mode denoted the basin-scale variations of SSChl a concentrations in the Sea of Japan, and the major peak from the end of February to the end of May displayed the spring bloom. The logarithm of recruitment per spawner (LNRPS) for sardine was positively affected by delays in the start and end dates of the spring phytoplankton bloom. The delay of the date of the lowest sea surface temperature contributed to the delay of the end of the spring bloom during the period 1998–2015 and elevated the LNRPS during the period 1982–2015. Sardine spawns in the southern Sea of Japan from April to May, hence, delays of the spring bloom prolonged its overlap with sardine larval periods, and thus improved the recruitment of Japanese sardine in the Sea of Japan.},

These phenomena have raised concerns in the northeastern North Pacific, but are out of the spotlight in the northwestern North Pacific in spite of potential implications for this productive system under increased climate variability. Pelagic communities in the Kuroshio ecosystem have both ecological and economic importance. However, patterns of climate-induced nonlinearity in pelagic communities are not well understood, and existence of non-stationarity in their relationships with physical drivers remains obscure. Here, we compile large numbers of climatic, oceanic and biological long-term time-series data and employ diverse statistical techniques to reveal such climate-induced nonlinearity and non-stationarity. Results show that pelagic communities in the Tsushima and Pacific areas (major areas in the Kuroshio ecosystem) had regime shifts in the late 1990s and late 1980s, respectively. Winter sea surface temperatures in the Kuroshio Current path and in the eastern part of East China Sea, which are respectively affected by the Kuroshio Current and Siberian High, correlate with dominant variability patterns in their pelagic communities. Furthermore, non-stationarity was identified with threshold years in the 1990s in the Tsushima area and in the 1980s in the Pacific area as a possible result of the declined variances in the Siberian High and Aleutian Low, respectively. Our findings provide insights on spatial differentiation of climate-induced nonlinearity and non-stationarity, which are valuable for the management of pelagic communities in the northwestern North Pacific under changing climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Climate-change associated changes in oceanographic conditions, particularly sea surface temperatures (SSTs), have systematically affected many marine fisheries resources around Japan. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index is considered one of the most important climate indices for describing basin-scale SST variations in the North Pacific, which are closely related to decadal variations in fisheries resources. Time series of the PDO index has been used to conventionally classify decadal conditions of ocean and fisheries resources around Japan as either warming or cooling regimes. It is now clear that for the 2000s to the mid-2010s, mostly during the “global surface warming slowdown,” the SST regime around Japan was unconventional; despite the PDO index being in a negative phase, which normally corresponds to a warming regime around Japan, SSTs exhibited decadal cooling in some waters and seasons. SSTs in the western part of the North Pacific subtropical gyre gradually decreased, particularly in autumn–spring, whereas SSTs in the western subarctic gyre and the Sea of Okhotsk increased. Moreover, SSTs between the subtropical and subarctic waters around northern Japan exhibited seasonal contrasts that were decadally intensified through the combined effects of cooling in winter–spring and warming in summer–autumn. Some major marine fisheries resources around Japan showed decadal increases or decreases beginning in the mid-2000s, and appeared to respond to the unconventional SST changes in their early life stages. In this paper, we review atmosphere and ocean conditions around Japan in the 2000s–2010s in terms of global climate, present an overview of potential impacts of decadal SST trends on five major commercial fisheries resources (walleye pollock, chum salmon, Japanese sardine, Japanese anchovy, and Japanese flying squid), and raise awareness that an unconventional regime can appear transiently during a state of global warming.},

Here, we investigate detailed physical, chemical, and biological environment variations in the spawning and nursery grounds along the Kuroshio and Kuroshio Extension area from intensive investigation in spawning season (April) of 2013. We found similar water mass property and copepod community in the egg-rich Kuroshio area and the larvae-rich downstream Kuroshio Extension area, indicating environmental variability is small during transportation and development processes. The egg-rich northern Izu Islands region showed high copepod abundance, although low nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations were observed. Eggs were scarce or absent in the second survey 10 days after abundant eggs were observed in the region, along with differences in water property and copepod community. This indicates that not only the location but also the specific water characteristic and copepod community are a determining factor for spawning. Indicator communities of copepod found in our study (indicator community of transportation process from spawning ground, of non-spawning ground, and of reproductive area in the Kuroshio Extension area) would be a key factor for recruitment prediction.},

abstract = {Identifying driving factors of recruitment dynamics is essential for understanding population dynamics of fisheries resources and managing them sustainably. Spawner abundance and environmental conditions have been assumed as driving factors of recruitment, and the relative influence of these two drivers in fish populations has been debated for a long time. We addressed this issue by applying cross-correlation analysis to the time series of recruitment and spawner abundance of 28 Japanese fisheries stocks. The analysis showed that spawner abundance was significantly related to recruitment in 18 of the 28 stocks, but in many stocks, particularly for small pelagic species, recruitment influenced the later spawner abundance more strongly, suggesting a strong influence of the environment. We also detected temporal shifts of recruitment levels corresponding to shifts of wide-area climatic and oceanographic conditions. These results indicate that both spawner abundance and environment might drive recruitment in many stocks, but the apparent effect of spawner abundance might be a by-product of long-term recruitment changes caused by environmental conditions in some cases. Considering our observations, efficient management strategies are needed that are robust to uncertainties of environmental impacts on fish dynamics and spawner-recruitment relationships and match life-history characteristics of managed stocks.},

However, the effects of climatic and density-dependent factors are complexly intertwined, and their respective effects remain controversial. We estimated climatic and density-dependent effects simultaneously using long-term egg survey data for Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus in the Tsushima Warm Current system. We found that in years with warmer sea surface temperature (SST) (climatic factor), egg abundance decreased in southern regions and increased in northern regions, and egg distribution expanded northward along the coast in the northernmost region. In years with colder SST, egg abundance decreased in northern regions, and egg distribution expanded offshore in the southernmost region. In contrast, spawning-stock biomass (SSB) (density-dependent factor) had little effect on the locations of main spawning grounds, whereas changes in SSB caused expansion or contraction of spawning grounds. The temporal peak of spawning shifted earlier in years with warmer SST and was delayed in years with colder SST, although the degree of the changes varied among regions. In contrast, spawning timing did not shift when SSB changed. These results indicate that climatic factors cause shifts and expansion or contraction of spawning grounds and also shifts in spawning timing, whereas density-dependent factors are related to expansion or contraction of spawning grounds but scarcely affect spawning timing. Our study shows that climatic and densitydependent factors differentially affect the spatiotemporal spawning patterns, with some overlap in their effects.},

Here, we describe the feeding habits and prey environments of larval and juvenile Japanese sardine and Japanese anchovy in the MWR from 1970−2013, during a time of dramatic changes in sardine and anchovy stocks. Fish and zooplankton were sampled from April to July using a variety of nets. Larval and juvenile sardine and anchovy fed on similar prey, such as copepodites of calanoid (e.g. Paracalanus spp.) and poecilostomatoid (e.g. Corycaeus affinis and Oncaea spp.) copepods, except for between 1988 and 1991. The abundance of dominant copepod prey species varied with sea surface temperature, with P. parvus and C. affinis most abundant at approximately 16 to 17°C and Oncaea spp. at temperatures exceeding 20°C. Decreased abundance of P. parvus after 1988 coincided with poor sardine recruitment. Although larval and juvenile sardine and anchovy have similar diets in the MWR, temperature possibly affects the distribution and abundance of their prey, and consequently fish stocks in the Kuroshio-Oyashio ecosystem.},
